# gematrix
Matrix Multiplication application based on sample from Intel VTune. 
Some improvedments by Raymond:
- add command line options so that choose algorithm and thread num without recompiling.
- choose thread no more than CPU no. 

Usage: matrix [thread_num] [algorithm no]
Collected thread no -1, algorithm no 1
Addr of buf1 = 0x7fa02ff010
Offs of buf1 = 0x7fa02ff180
Addr of buf2 = 0x7f9e2fe010
Offs of buf2 = 0x7f9e2fe1c0
Addr of buf3 = 0x7f9c2fd010
Offs of buf3 = 0x7f9c2fd100
Addr of buf4 = 0x7f9a2fc010
Offs of buf4 = 0x7f9a2fc140
